# Contribution Guidelines

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **External API changes and significant modifications** should be subject to a **pull request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
3. Use a non-`master` branch for ongoing work.
4. Adhere to existing code style as much as possible.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.
