## âœ¨ Features

- **Easily export collections to Excel.** Supercharge your Laravel collections and export them directly to an Excel or CSV document. Exporting has never been so easy.

- **Supercharged exports.** Export queries with automatic chunking for better performance. You provide us the query, we handle the performance. Exporting even larger datasets? No worries, Laravel Excel has your back. You can queue your exports so all of this happens in the background.

- **Supercharged imports.** Import workbooks and worksheets to Eloquent models with chunk reading and batch inserts! Have large files? You can queue every chunk of a file! Your entire import will happen in the background.

- **Export Blade views.** Want to have a custom layout in your spreadsheet? Use a HTML table in a Blade view and export that to Excel.

You can find the full documentation of Laravel Excel [on the website](https://docs.laravel-excel.com).

We welcome suggestions for improving our docs. The documentation repository can be found at [https://github.com/Maatwebsite/laravel-excel-docs](https://github.com/Maatwebsite/laravel-excel-docs).

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Course

We are currently building a video course called "Advanced Laravel Excel". In this video course weâ€™ll build a small application with real-life, complex imports and exports that go beyond simple user imports and exports. Weâ€™ll go step-by-step and tackle implementing Laravel Excel in a performant way.

If you sign up now, youâ€™ll get notified when the course launches and get it for the early bird price of $69 instead of ~~$99~~.

## :mailbox_with_mail: License & Postcardware

Laravel Excel is completely free (MIT license) to use, however the package is licensed as Postcardware. This means that if it makes it to your production environment, we would very much appreciate receiving a postcard from your hometown.
