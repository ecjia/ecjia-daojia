    | Cache Control Attack
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Cache-control is an HTTP header that dictates browser caching behavior.
    | In a nutshell, when someone visits a website, their browser will save certain
    | resources, such as images and website data, in a store called the cache.
    | When that user revisits the same website, cache-control sets the rules which
    | determine whether that user will have those resources loaded from their local
    | cache, or whether the browser will have to send a request to the server for
    | fresh resources. In order to understand cache-control in greater depth,
    |Â a basic understanding of browser caching and HTTP headers is required.
