# Examples

## Run the examples

Start in the project directory. Make sure you install the Composer dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

Then, in a new terminal, start the example server (and leave it running):
```bash
php -S localhost:8080 examples/server.php
```

Now run the examples!
```bash
php examples/client.php
```


## Extend the examples

Start by looking in the "examples/src" directory. Then replace it all with your
project code.
